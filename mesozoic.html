    <h2>Animals of the Mesozoic Era</h2>

    <div class="animal">
        <h3>Triassic Period: <span class="period">252-201 million years ago</span></h3>
        <img src="coel.jpg" alt="Coelophysis">
        <h4>Coelophysis</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Coelophysis was a small, lightweight, and agile dinosaur that lived during the Late Triassic period, around 210 million years ago. It is one of the earliest known theropods and is recognized for its slender body, long neck, and tail. Coelophysis was a bipedal carnivore, standing about 3 meters (10 feet) long and weighing approximately 15-20 kilograms (33-44 pounds). It had long, sharp teeth suited for catching small prey, such as early mammals, amphibians, and other small dinosaurs. Its long, slender legs suggest it was a fast runner, likely using its speed and agility to hunt or scavenge for food.</p>
        <p><strong>Interesting Facts:</strong> One of the most notable features of Coelophysis is its social behavior. Fossil evidence suggests that it may have lived and hunted in groups, a behavior not commonly associated with many early dinosaurs. In some fossil sites, hundreds of Coelophysis individuals have been found together, which may indicate that they traveled or hunted in packs. These dinosaurs also exhibited a high degree of sexual dimorphism, with males and females differing in size. Coelophysis is often considered a "basal" theropod, meaning it is an early member of the theropod group, which eventually gave rise to larger, more famous dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex.</p>
        <p><strong>Scientific Importance:</strong> Coelophysis is significant because it provides important insights into the early evolution of theropod dinosaurs, showcasing characteristics that would later be amplified in more advanced dinosaurs. Its fossil record helps scientists understand the early development of bipedal locomotion, predatory behaviors, and social interactions in dinosaurs. As one of the earliest known dinosaurs, Coelophysis serves as a model for understanding the diversity and evolutionary pathways that would eventually lead to the rise of more specialized dinosaur groups, including the massive predators and herbivores that dominated the Mesozoic.</p>

        <h3>Jurassic Period: <span class="period">201-145 million years ago</span></h3>
        <img src="brach.jpg" alt="Brachiosaurus">
        <h4>Brachiosaurus</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Brachiosaurus was a massive, long-necked herbivorous dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period, around 154 to 153 million years ago. This giant sauropod is notable for its unique body structure, with a long neck and relatively short tail. Unlike most other sauropods, Brachiosaurus had a much taller front end, as its front legs were longer than its hind legs. This distinctive feature gave it a more upright posture, allowing it to reach vegetation high in trees, making it an ideal browser of conifers and other tall plants. Brachiosaurus could grow up to 80 feet (24 meters) long and weigh up to 50 tons, making it one of the largest land animals of its time.</p>
        <p><strong>Interesting Facts:</strong> Brachiosaurus is often recognized for its unique body shape compared to other sauropods, such as Apatosaurus and Diplodocus. Its long neck and elevated front legs allowed it to feed on foliage high up in trees, giving it access to food sources that many other herbivores could not reach. Brachiosaurus had a relatively short tail, which further distinguishes it from many other large sauropods. It is thought to have lived in herds, roaming large areas of what is now North America and parts of Africa. Fossilized remains of Brachiosaurus have been found in both regions, suggesting that it was widespread across the Jurassic world.</p>
        <p><strong>Scientific Importance:</strong> Brachiosaurus holds a key place in the study of sauropod evolution, particularly due to its unique body structure and feeding habits. Its elevated front legs and long neck suggest early adaptations to browsing on high vegetation, a feeding strategy that would later become common among large sauropods. As one of the largest land animals ever to exist, Brachiosaurus provides important insight into the size and diversity of dinosaur ecosystems during the Jurassic period. The fossil evidence also helps paleontologists understand the distribution of large herbivores during the Mesozoic era and how different groups of dinosaurs evolved to exploit various ecological niches.</p>

        <h3>Cretaceous Period: <span class="period">145-66 million years ago</span></h3>
        <img src="trex.jpg" alt="Tyrannosaurus rex">
        <h4>Tyrannosaurus Rex</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Tyrannosaurus rex, commonly known as T. rex, was one of the most iconic and fearsome dinosaurs to ever live, dominating the ecosystems of the Late Cretaceous period, around 68 to 66 million years ago. It was a large theropod dinosaur, reaching lengths of up to 40 feet (12 meters) and standing about 12 feet (3.7 meters) tall at the hips. T. rex had a massive skull, powerful jaws, and sharp teeth that could crush bone, making it an apex predator. Its arms were small relative to its body, but its legs were strong and muscular, enabling it to run at speeds of up to 20–25 mph (32–40 km/h), though it likely relied more on ambush and strength to capture prey. It had a long, heavy tail that helped balance its large head and body.</p>
        <p><strong>Interesting Facts:</strong> T. rex's powerful bite was one of the most formidable in the animal kingdom, with jaw muscles capable of exerting over 12,000 pounds of force. This made it capable of eating almost anything, from large herbivorous dinosaurs like Triceratops to smaller animals. Despite its tiny, seemingly useless arms, T. rex may have used them for balance during movement or possibly for grasping prey while biting. Fossil evidence suggests that T. rex had excellent vision and could likely detect movement at great distances, aiding in hunting. There is also debate among scientists about whether T. rex was purely a predator or also a scavenger, with some evidence suggesting it may have engaged in both behaviors.</p>
        <p><strong>Scientific Importance:</strong> T. rex is a crucial species in understanding the apex predator role within ancient ecosystems. As one of the largest land carnivores to have ever existed, it offers valuable insight into the evolution of theropod dinosaurs and their adaptations for hunting and survival. Its well-preserved fossils have provided scientists with a wealth of information about dinosaur anatomy, behavior, and physiology. T. rex’s position at the top of the food chain in the Late Cretaceous helps paleontologists understand predator-prey dynamics and the evolutionary arms race between carnivorous and herbivorous dinosaurs. Furthermore, T. rex remains one of the most studied and celebrated dinosaurs, influencing both paleontology and popular culture.</p>
